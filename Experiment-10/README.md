# Experiment 10: Stock Price Simulation

## Objective
Predict future stock prices using Monte Carlo Simulation techniques.

## Description
This experiment uses Monte Carlo methods to simulate and predict future stock price movements based on historical data and statistical modeling.

## Tools and Libraries
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- yfinance (for stock data)

## Tasks
1. Fetch historical stock price data
2. Calculate returns and volatility
3. Implement Monte Carlo simulation for stock price prediction
4. Generate multiple price path scenarios
5. Analyze simulation results and confidence intervals
6. Visualize price predictions and probability distributions
7. Compare simulated vs actual stock movements
8. Risk assessment and portfolio implications

## Expected Outcomes
- Monte Carlo simulation model for stock price prediction
- Multiple future price scenarios and probability ranges
- Understanding of financial modeling with Monte Carlo methods
- Visualization of price paths and risk distributions
- Statistical analysis of simulation results
