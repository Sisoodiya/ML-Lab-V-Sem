# Experiment 07: Digit Recognition

## Objective
Recognize handwritten digits (MNIST) using an Artificial Neural Network.

## Description
This experiment implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, demonstrating fundamental deep learning concepts.

## Tools and Libraries
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Tasks
1. Load and explore the MNIST handwritten digits dataset
2. Preprocess and normalize image data
3. Design neural network architecture
4. Configure model compilation (optimizer, loss, metrics)
5. Train the neural network model
6. Evaluate model performance on test data
7. Visualize training history and results
8. Test model on individual digit images

## Expected Outcomes
- Trained neural network for digit classification
- High accuracy on MNIST test set
- Understanding of neural network architecture
- Visualization of model predictions and accuracy
- Loss and accuracy curves during training
