# Experiment 01: Environment Setup

## Objective
Installation and setup of Python libraries and tools for Machine Learning experiments.

## Description
This experiment focuses on setting up the development environment for machine learning projects. It includes installing essential Python libraries, configuring Jupyter notebook, and verifying the installation.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow

## Tasks
1. Install Python and package manager (pip)
2. Create virtual environment
3. Install required ML libraries from requirements.txt
4. Verify installation by importing libraries
5. Set up Jupyter notebook environment

## Expected Outcomes
- Working Python ML environment
- Successfully imported all required libraries
- Functional Jupyter notebook setup
