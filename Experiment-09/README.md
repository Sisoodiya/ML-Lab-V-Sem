# Experiment 09: Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
Classify text as Positive or Negative using the Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.

## Description
This experiment implements sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes algorithm to classify text reviews or comments as positive or negative sentiment.

## Tools and Libraries
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- Seaborn
- WordCloud (for visualization)

## Tasks
1. Load and explore sentiment analysis dataset (movie reviews, tweets, etc.)
2. Text preprocessing and cleaning
3. Feature extraction using Bag of Words or TF-IDF
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train Naive Bayes classifier
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Visualize word clouds for positive/negative sentiments
8. Test classifier on new text samples

## Expected Outcomes
- Trained Naive Bayes model for sentiment classification
- Accurate sentiment prediction on test data
- Understanding of text classification techniques
- Word clouds showing important features for each sentiment
- Performance metrics and confusion matrix
