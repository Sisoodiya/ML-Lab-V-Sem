# Experiment 04: Classification Models

## Objective
Build and compare classification models (Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree) to predict product purchase from social media data.

## Description
This experiment implements multiple classification algorithms to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on social media behavior and demographic data.

## Tools and Libraries
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Tasks
1. Load and explore social media/customer dataset
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Implement Logistic Regression classifier
4. Implement k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier
5. Implement Decision Tree classifier
6. Compare model performances using various metrics
7. Visualize classification results and decision boundaries

## Expected Outcomes
- Three trained classification models
- Performance comparison between different algorithms
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- ROC curves and accuracy metrics
