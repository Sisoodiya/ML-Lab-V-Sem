# Experiment 08: Email Spam Detection

## Objective
Build a spam classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect spam emails.

## Description
This experiment implements an SVM-based text classification system to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails using natural language processing techniques.

## Tools and Libraries
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- Seaborn

## Tasks
1. Load and explore email spam dataset
2. Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words removal, stemming)
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train Support Vector Machine classifier
6. Evaluate model performance using various metrics
7. Analyze feature importance and model interpretation
8. Test classifier on new email examples

## Expected Outcomes
- Trained SVM model for spam detection
- High accuracy in classifying spam vs legitimate emails
- Understanding of text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix and classification report
