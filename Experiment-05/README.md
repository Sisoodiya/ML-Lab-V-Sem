# Experiment 05: Customer Segmentation

## Objective
Cluster customers based on buying behavior using K-means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms.

## Description
This experiment applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing patterns and demographics.

## Tools and Libraries
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy

## Tasks
1. Load and explore customer dataset
2. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
3. Determine optimal number of clusters using Elbow method
4. Implement K-means clustering
5. Implement Hierarchical clustering
6. Compare clustering results
7. Visualize customer segments
8. Interpret and analyze cluster characteristics

## Expected Outcomes
- Customer segments identified through clustering
- Optimal number of clusters determined
- Comparison between K-means and Hierarchical clustering
- Visualization of customer segments
- Business insights from customer segmentation
